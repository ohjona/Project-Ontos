## Part 1: Verdict Summary

| Reviewer | Role | Verdict | Blocking | Major | Minor |
|----------|------|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| Chief Architect | First-pass | READY FOR BOARD | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Claude | Alignment | Approve with changes | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Codex | Adversarial | Request revision | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| Gemini | Peer | Request revision | 2 | 0 | 1 |

**Consensus:** 1/4 Approve (CA), 3/4 Request revision

**Overall Status:** Needs fixes before merge

---

## Part 2: Blocking Issues (Must Fix Before Merge)

| # | Issue | Flagged By | File | Description | Suggested Fix |
|---|-------|------------|------|-------------|---------------|
| B-1 | `FrontmatterParseError` not implemented | Claude, Codex, Gemini | `frontmatter.py` | Spec §3.5 requires `FrontmatterParseError` dataclass with filepath, line, column, message fields. Completely missing. | Implement dataclass per spec OR explicitly defer to v3.2 with spec amendment |
| B-2 | Missing Obsidian test file | CA, Claude, Codex, Gemini | `tests/` | No `test_map_obsidian.py` — Obsidian wikilink formatting lacks automated tests | Create test file with wikilink format verification |

**Total blocking issues:** 2 (deduplicated)

**Note on B-1:** CA rated this as "LOW" severity. Claude flagged as blocking but offers "implement or defer" option. Decision point for CA: implement now or defer with documentation.

---

## Part 3: Required Actions for Antigravity

| Priority | Action | Issue | File | Estimated Effort |
|----------|--------|-------|------|------------------|
| 1 | Add `test_map_obsidian.py` with wikilink tests | B-2 | `tests/test_map_obsidian.py` | Low (~30 min) |
| 2 | Implement `FrontmatterParseError` OR get CA approval to defer | B-1 | `frontmatter.py` | Med (~1 hr) or N/A |
| 3 | Add test for non-string summary in rich compact mode | M-2 | `test_map_compact.py` | Low |
| 4 | Consider gating lenient reads behind `--obsidian` flag | M-1 | `map.py:507` | Low |

**Instructions for Antigravity:**

1. Fix issues in priority order
2. One commit per issue: `fix(scope): description — addresses B-X`
3. Run `pytest tests/ -v` after each fix
4. Post fix summary to PR #54 when complete
5. Tag @codex for verification review (D.5a)

---

## Part 4: Major Issues (Should Fix Before Merge)

| # | Issue | Flagged By | File | Consensus | Recommendation |
|---|-------|------------|------|-----------|----------------|
| M-1 | Obsidian leniency applied unconditionally | Codex | `map.py:507` | 1/4 | **CA decides** — intentional design? |
| M-2 | Non-string summary may crash rich compact | Codex | `map.py:323` | 1/4 | Fix (add `str()` coercion) |
| M-3 | Schema version upgrade hint not implemented | Claude, Codex, Gemini | `frontmatter.py` | 3/4 | Defer to v3.2 (same as B-1) |
| M-4 | Cache API diverges from spec (caller provides mtime) | Codex | `cache.py` | 1/4 | **No action** — Claude noted this as superior design |

**Recommendation:** Fix M-2. M-1/M-3 require CA decision. M-4 is a design choice, not a bug.

---

## Part 5: Minor Issues (Consider Fixing)

| # | Issue | Flagged By | File | Recommendation |
|---|-------|------------|------|----------------|
| m-1 | Missing edge case tests | Claude, Codex | various | Defer (coverage adequate) |
| m-2 | `detect_obsidian_vault()` unused | Claude | `obsidian.py` | Defer (future use) |
| m-3 | Non-UTF8 file handling | Claude, Codex | `obsidian.py` | Defer (document limitation) |
| m-4 | Doctor config uses `cwd` not repo root | Codex | `doctor.py:456` | Defer (edge case) |
| m-5 | Pre-existing `core/` → `io/` violation | CA, Claude, Codex | `config.py:229` | N/A (not Track A) |

---

## Part 6: Spec Compliance Summary

| Spec Section | CA | Claude | Codex | Gemini | Status |
|--------------|-----|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| §3.1 Tags/Aliases | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Compliant** |
| §3.2 Obsidian Mode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Compliant** |
| §3.3 Cache | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Compliant (design improved) |
| §3.4 Compact | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Compliant** |
| §3.5 Errors/Leniency | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **Major gaps** (FrontmatterParseError) |
| §3.6 Doctor Verbose | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Compliant (minor cwd issue) |
| §3.7 Filter | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Compliant** |

**Spec compliance verdict:** §3.5 has major gaps; other sections fully compliant

---

## Part 7: Edge Case Coverage Summary

From adversarial review (Codex) + Claude:

| Component | Cases Handled | Gaps Found | Risk |
|-----------|--------------|------------|------|
| normalize_tags/aliases | 9/9 | Tests for null/whitespace missing | Low |
| DocumentCache | 6/9 | OSError handling deferred to caller | Low |
| Compact escaping | 8/8 | None | Low |
| Filter parsing | 10/10 | Tests for edge cases missing | Low |
| Wikilink formatting | 4/4 | Tests missing entirely | **Medium** |
| Obsidian leniency | 5/6 | Non-UTF8 handling | Low |

**Edge case coverage verdict:** Adequate — logic handles cases, tests lag behind

---

## Part 8: Test Coverage Assessment

| Reviewer | Assessment | Key Gaps Identified |
|----------|------------|---------------------|
| CA | Adequate | Obsidian test file missing |
| Claude | Adequate | 11/11 pass, edge case tests sparse |
| Codex | Adequate | Obsidian + edge cases missing |
| Gemini | Good | Obsidian tests missing |

**Consensus:** Adequate

**Required test additions:**

| Test | Component | Why Needed | Priority |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| `test_map_obsidian.py` | Wikilink formatting | B-2: No automated tests | **Must** |
| Non-string summary test | Compact output | M-2: Crash prevention | Should |

---

## Part 9: Architecture Compliance

| Constraint | CA | Claude | Codex | Gemini | Status |
|------------|-----|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| No `core/` → `io/` imports | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | Pre-existing violation (not Track A) |
| No `core/` → `commands/` imports | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Compliant** |
| File placement correct | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Compliant** |

**Architecture verdict:** Compliant (Track A introduces no new violations)

## Part 10: Agreement & Disagreement Analysis

### Strong Agreement (3+ reviewers)

| Topic | Consensus | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `FrontmatterParseError` missing | 3/4 flagged | B-1 — Must address |
| Obsidian tests missing | 4/4 flagged | B-2 — Must fix |
| Core features work correctly | 4/4 agree | Smoke tests pass |
| §3.1, §3.2, §3.4, §3.7 compliant | 4/4 agree | Bulk of work is correct |
| Code quality is good | 4/4 agree | Clean implementation |

### Disagreement

| Topic | CA/Claude | Codex | Gemini | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| B-1 severity | Low/Blocking | Blocking | Blocking | **CA decides:** implement or defer |
| Cache API design | Superior | Deviation | Compliant | Accept as improvement |
| Obsidian leniency scope | Not flagged | Major issue | Not flagged | **CA clarifies intent** |
| Doctor cwd usage | Not flagged | Minor issue | Not flagged | Defer |

### Unique Findings

| Issue | Found By | Why Others Missed? | Valid? |
|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Lenient reads applied globally | Codex | Others focused on feature correctness | Yes — worth CA input |
| Doctor uses cwd not repo root | Codex | Edge case (run from subdir) | Yes — minor |
| Rich compact may crash on non-string | Codex | Edge case | Yes — should fix |

---

## Part 11: Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Flagged By | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Obsidian wikilinks wrong in production | Low | High | All | B-2: Add tests |
| FrontmatterParseError missing | Medium | Low | 3/4 | B-1: Implement or defer |
| Lenient parsing alters expected behavior | Low | Medium | Codex | CA confirms intent |

**Overall risk level:** Low-Medium

---

## Part 12: Decision Summary

**PR #54 Status:** Needs fixes

**Issue counts:**
- Blocking: 2
- Major: 4 (1 agreed fix, 1 design choice, 2 CA decision)
- Minor: 5

**Next step:** D.4a — Antigravity fixes B-1 (per CA guidance) and B-2

**Recommended path:**
1. **Immediate:** Antigravity adds obsidian tests (B-2)
2. **CA decides:** Implement `FrontmatterParseError` now OR defer to v3.2 with spec note (B-1)
3. **Quick fix:** Add `str()` coercion for rich compact summaries (M-2)
4. **D.5a:** Codex verification after fixes
5. **D.6a:** CA final approval

---

## Part 13: Consolidation Notes

1. **Consensus is strong on functionality** — All reviewers agree core features work correctly. Smoke tests pass. 440 tests pass.

2. **§3.5 is the blocker** — The only significant gap is `FrontmatterParseError`. This was always a secondary feature (better error messages). CA decision: implement for v3.1.0 or explicitly defer?

3. **Cache design is an improvement** — Claude explicitly praised the I/O-free design. Codex flagged as "deviation" but it's a better pattern. No action needed.

4. **Obsidian leniency scope needs clarification** — Codex is right that lenient reads are applied unconditionally. Is this intentional (simpler, works everywhere) or a bug (should be gated by `--obsidian`)? CA to clarify.

5. **Test coverage is the easy win** — Adding `test_map_obsidian.py` is ~30 minutes work and resolves the most agreed-upon issue.
