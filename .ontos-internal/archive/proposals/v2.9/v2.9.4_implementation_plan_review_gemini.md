# v2.9.4 Implementation Plan Review

**Reviewer:** Gemini (Google DeepMind)
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Target:** [v2.9_implementation_plan.md](../../v2.9/v2.9_implementation_plan.md)
**Status:** **Needs Revision** (Plan is stale relative to codebase)

---

## Assessment

**[Overall: Needs Revision]**

The plan is technically sound as an architectural record but **operationally stale**.

It describes the **current state of the codebase** as "future work." Specifically, the features listed as "Pending" (Deprecation Warnings, `install.py` Bootstrap) are **already implemented** in the files I see on disk.

The plan effectively documents what *has been done* rather than what *needs to be done*, except for the final documentation/release steps (PR #35/36). Proceeding with this plan as-is would confuse a coding agent, who might try to re-implement existing features or overwrite valid code.

## Reality Alignment

**[Poor - Lagging Reality]**

The plan is out of sync with the codebase state:

1.  **install.py**: The plan lists this as "Pending" (PR #34).
    *   **Reality:** `install.py` exists in the root, implements the SHA256 verification, backup logic, and uses `v2.9.3` as the default version.
2.  **Deprecation Warnings**: The plan lists this as "Next" (PR #34).
    *   **Reality:** `.ontos/scripts/ontos_lib.py` already contains the `FutureWarning`, and the `ontos.py` dispatcher already sets `ONTOS_CLI_DISPATCH`.
3.  **Curation/Schema**: The plan correctly identifies these as "Merged", which aligns with reality.

## Ambiguities That Will Cause Problems

1.  **Redundant Implementation Risk**: A coding agent reading "PR #34: install.py Bootstrap ... PENDING" will try to create `install.py`. Since the file exists, it might overwrite it (potentially reverting the version bump to 2.9.3 or losing small fixes) or fail with "file exists" errors.
2.  **Version Confusion**: The plan mentions `v2.9.0` and `v2.9.2` in text, but the code is already at `v2.9.3`. The plan needs to be re-baselined to `v2.9.4` (the target).

## What I Would Do Differently

1.  **Mark Completed Phases**: I would update Section 12 (Implementation Progress) to mark PR #34 as **MERGED/COMPLETE**.
2.  **Refocus on PR #35/36**: The only remaining work is "Documentation & Release" (PR #35/36 in the plan). I would strip the implementation details for the completed features and focus the plan entirely on the release checklist (docs, changelog, final verification).
3.  **CLI Entry Point Check**: In `install.py`, the fallback `EXPECTED_FILES` list includes `.ontos/scripts/ontos_lib.py`. Since this file is deprecated, I would ensure the installer *also* checks for the new core modules (e.g., `.ontos/scripts/ontos/core/__init__.py`) to be future-proof for v3.0. (Note: The current code does check `ontos/core/context.py`, which is sufficient).

## Specific Feedback

*   **Section 2.4 (install.py)**: The code in the plan matches the file on disk almost exactly, confirming the work is done.
*   **Section 12 (Progress)**:
    *   Update `PR #34 Deprecation Warnings` to **DONE**.
    *   Update `PR #35 install.py Bootstrap` to **DONE**.
    *   Update `PR #36 Documentation & Release` to **IN PROGRESS**.
*   **Section 5.2 (ontos_lib.py)**: The plan proposes adding warnings. The file already has them.
*   **General**: The plan is excellent as a design document (ADR) for what *was* built. It just shouldn't be used as a "todo list" anymore.

**Action Item**: Update the plan to reflect the completed status of PRs #34 and #35, then proceed immediately to PR #36 (Documentation & Release).
