# Review: v2.9.4 Implementation Plan (Codex GPT-5)

**Reviewer:** Codex (GPT-5)
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Scope:** Reality-aligned review of `v2.9_implementation_plan.md` for v2.9.4

## Assessment
Needs Revision

## Reality Alignment
- The plan header says v1.4.0 and “Ready for Implementation (v2.9.2 next),” but the codebase is already v2.9.2 with deprecation warnings merged. This makes the status and “next” steps stale.
- Implementation progress shows PR #34 as NEXT; it is already merged. PR #35 (install.py) is the actual next step.
- “Current State” lists v2.9.1 and 390 tests, but the codebase is v2.9.2 with ~397 tests.
- Deprecation suppression policy says `ONTOS_NO_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS=1` suppresses warnings, but `ontos_lib` still emits `FutureWarning` unconditionally.

## Ambiguities That Will Cause Problems
- **PR sequencing:** v2.9.2 is already shipped, but the plan still positions it as “next.”
- **Deprecation scope:** The plan implies consistent suppression behavior, but `ontos_lib` ignores the suppression env var.
- **Notice coverage:** Several scripts appear directly runnable but lack the deprecation notice; the plan doesn’t clarify whether they’re internal-only.
- **Strict vs curated behavior:** The plan doesn’t explicitly state whether L0/L1 should fail `--strict` or only be informational; current code treats them as informational even in strict mode.

## What I Would Do Differently
- **Make the plan mirror reality first:** update the status, current state, and progress table to reflect v2.9.2 and merged PR #34.
- **Unify deprecation suppression policy:** either honor `ONTOS_NO_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS` in `ontos_lib`, or document that import warnings are intentionally unsuppressible.
- **Declare deprecation scope:** list internal-only scripts or add the notice pattern everywhere.
- **Define strict semantics explicitly:** lock in whether `--strict` fails for L0/L1 or not, and align code and plan accordingly.

## Specific Feedback
- **Status and versioning:** Update “Ready for Implementation (v2.9.2 next)” to reflect v2.9.3/2.9.4 as next steps.
- **Current state:** Update to v2.9.2 and 397 tests (or exact current count).
- **Implementation progress:** Mark PR #34 as merged and set PR #35 as active.
- **Deprecation suppression:** `ontos_lib` should honor `ONTOS_NO_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS` or the plan should explicitly exclude it.
- **Script coverage:** Decide whether these scripts are internal-only or should emit notices:
  - `ontos_install_hooks.py`
  - `ontos_migrate_frontmatter.py`
  - `ontos_migrate_v2.py`
  - `ontos_pre_commit_check.py`
  - `ontos_pre_push_check.py`
  - `ontos_remove_frontmatter.py`
  - `ontos_summarize.py`
- **Strict/curated semantics:** Document whether L0/L1 are informational even under `--strict`, matching current implementation.
